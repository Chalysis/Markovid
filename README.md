# Description

Named after the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov, a Markov chain is a special type of discrete stochastic process in which the probability of an event occurring depends only on the immediately preceding event. This is also known as Markov model. 

Markov chains have numerous applications in Bayesian insights, thermodynamics, chemistry, economics, finance, signal processing, information theory and speech processing. For example, for neural networks, they serve in Boltzmann machines. In genetics, Markov chains are used to describe the change in gene frequencies in a small population.

In the same way, Markov analysis, allows finding the probability that a system is in a particular state at a given time. More importantly, it allows you to find the long-term average or steady-state probabilities for each state. With this information, the behavior of the system can be predicted over time. The hardest task is recognizing when it can be applied. The most important feature to look for in memory from one event to another.


# Project approach

The project is focused on the use of a probabilistic model using Python 3 using data concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from different countries will be used to compare and obtain informative conclusions on these data.
