# Description: 

Named after the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov, a Markov chain is a special type of discrete stochastic process in which the probability of an event occurring depends only on the immediately preceding event is known as the Markov chain or Markov model. 

Markov chains have numerous applications as measurable models of real-world forms cash trade rates, and creature populace dynamics, as well as in Bayesian insights, thermodynamics, chemistry, economics, finance, signal processing, information theory and speech processing. For example, for neural networks, they serve in Boltzmann machines. In genetics, Markov chains are used to describe the change in gene frequencies in a small population.

# Project approach

The project is focused on the use of a probabilistic model using Python 3 using data concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from different countries will be used to compare and obtain informative conclusions on these data.
